[ENTER EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION HERE]
Supercell should be installed. GULP should be in PATH. Run script df_cfg.bash.

The command used to generate supercells in this case is:

supercell -i PbSnTe2.cif -s 1x1x2 -m -v 2 -o [OUTPUT DIRECTORY]/PbSnTe_1x1x2 &

Note that the [OUTPUT DIRECTORY] should exist when running the command.
The analysis is then performed with the GULP program.
